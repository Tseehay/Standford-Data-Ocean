This alters the expression of genes.\n",

Consequently, this mechanism switches some genes off because the DNA is wrapped around the histone proteins, and is inaccessible to the proteins that read DNA to make RNA, whereas other genes get expressed because they are not wrapped around histones.\n",

ChIP-Seq, a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and massively parallel sequencing, delves into the interactions between proteins, DNA, and RNA, revealing critical regulatory events in many biological processes and disease states. ChIP-Seq is used to identify transcription factor binding sites, track histone modifications across the genome, and constrain chromatin structure and function."
